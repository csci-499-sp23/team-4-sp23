# About Wheel Call You:
Wheel Call You is an application that focuses on combating the problem of accesibility for transportation for college students. College Students have a large difficulty in adjusting to moving, meeting new colege students, and affording the college experience On avergae, the avergae expenses for moving costs for local moving costs can rate anywhere from $65-$250 per hour. In certain college towns, and even for global students they do not have the access of ontaining a vechile. 

What Do We Do ? 
Wheel Call You makes it easier for students moving in or out of their college towns to be matched with other university students that are within a close proximity to them, carpool together. Users are verified based on two - factor authencation and fill out a profile with their bio, university, school, and age information. Students then proceed to take a survey that allows them to be able to get an understanding of their identity, riding prefences, and driving experience. Students will then be matched to those who attend the same school as them and live within close proximity.  Users can filter their matches based on survey results and riding prefences. They can chat with their messages and choose to purchase a ride with them by viewing the truck icon that displays all vechiles within proximity of them, and how far there school is from them. 

Wheel Call You also allows for parents to be part of the process to help move, by allowing them to view their childs matches and help them select a vechile.
